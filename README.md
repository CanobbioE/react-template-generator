# React Template Generator
A CLI to automatically generate components and whatnot for the "frankfurt gang" development team.

The idea is to have a tool like the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) for ReactTS and ReactNative.

Initially we will only need to generate components like:

```bash
$ ng -g c component
```
should be equivalent to
```bash
$ rtg -g c component
```
